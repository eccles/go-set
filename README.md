# Selection set

Sets are useful when implementing filtering. This is usually done 
by the intersection of a selection set and a target object. The intersection 
only returns the attributes of the target object specified in the selection set.

Using the sets class from python3 as an example:

```go
```

# Deselection set

The opposite case is redact all fields that are not selected:

```go
```
